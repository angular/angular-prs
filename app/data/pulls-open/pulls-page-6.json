    "body": "Angular includes a small subset of jQuery out of the box called jqLite. Normally, angular wraps all the elements it passes to its directives in jqLite. When jQuery is loaded ahead of angular, angular instead wraps its elements in the full implementation of jQuery. Additionally, angular wraps its events in jQuery. These jQuery events work throughout most of angular. Angular-touch currently was not working with those jQuery-wrapped events. Touches were registering inconsistently and rarely when using the ngClick directive. This commit should fix that. I took it from another person I found on github. I'm not sure why his changes were never merged into the main angular.js repo, but I've verified that it works and I decided to submit a pull request for it. There is a bug/issue thread I found relating to this. It is linked below.\r\nhttps://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4001\r\n",

We are still waiting for more discussion within the team or more info from the contributor before making the final decision.",

So, I've developed a feature that add an extra behaviour to $log. In the $logProvider, I created a method called debugLevel that receives a string as parameter and, based on that parameter, the application change its debug level.\r\n\r\nWith this feature, setting debugLevel to 'error' will log only error messages, while setting 'log' will debug the application in a \"trace like\" mode.\r\n\r\n- error:   log only error messages;\r\n- warn:   log warn and error messages;\r\n- info:     log info, warn and error messages;\r\n- log:      log log and all other messages (trace like).\r\n\r\n~~I'm not able to write tests for this feature and I think the code can be cleaner, but it helped me a lot.~~ In the two last commits I've added two tests to this feature: one to ensure that if debugLevel is not defined, the application will log as default and one setting the level to 'warn'.\r\n\r\n**Other Comments:**\r\n\r\nngLog can now log in window console based on a debug level, that can be redefined in LogProvider. Defaults to 'log'.",

    "body": "Request Type: bug\n\nHow to reproduce: 6f776102b23f413f7f2443ef\n\n1. create a route with optional parameters, eg. $routeProvider.when('/profile/:userId?', ...)\n\n2. angular will add the automatic redirect with or without the trailing /, in this case '/profile/userId?/'\n\n3. point your browser to the redirect http://localhost/#!/profile/0/, you'll see the encoded ? (%3F) at the end of the url: http://localhost/#!/profile/0%3F\n\nComponent(s): ngRoute\n\nImpact: medium\n\nComplexity: small\n\nThis issue is related to: \n\n**Detailed Description:**\n\nIn line with #5746, this changes how parameters are interpolated in redirectTo strings.\n\nFirst, I added a test case (it's my first in Javascript ever, so bear with me) which exhibits the failure:\n\n```\n        Expected '/bar/id1/subid3?/23' to equal '/bar/id1/subid3/23'.\n        Error: Expected '/bar/id1/subid3?/23' to equal '/bar/id1/subid3/23'.\n            at null.<anonymous> (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/test/ngRoute/routeSpec.js:826:34)\n            at Object.invoke (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/src/auto/injector.js:801:17)\n            at workFn (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/src/ngMock/angular-mocks.js:2187:20)\n            at window.inject.angular.mock.inject (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/src/ngMock/angular-mocks.js:2159:42)\n            at null.<anonymous> (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/test/ngRoute/routeSpec.js:822:7)\n        Expected '/bar/id1/?/23' to equal '/bar/id1/23'.\n        Error: Expected '/bar/id1/?/23' to equal '/bar/id1/23'.\n            at null.<anonymous> (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/test/ngRoute/routeSpec.js:832:34)\n            at Object.invoke (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/src/auto/injector.js:801:17)\n            at workFn (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/src/ngMock/angular-mocks.js:2187:20)\n            at window.inject.angular.mock.inject (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/src/ngMock/angular-mocks.js:2159:42)\n            at null.<anonymous> (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/test/ngRoute/routeSpec.js:822:7)\n        Expected '/path/foovalue/barvalue*/1' to equal '/path/foovalue/barvalue/1'.\n        Error: Expected '/path/foovalue/barvalue*/1' to equal '/path/foovalue/barvalue/1'.\n            at null.<anonymous> (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/test/ngRoute/routeSpec.js:837:34)\n            at Object.invoke (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/src/auto/injector.js:801:17)\n            at workFn (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/src/ngMock/angular-mocks.js:2187:20)\n            at window.inject.angular.mock.inject (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/src/ngMock/angular-mocks.js:2159:42)\n            at null.<anonymous> (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/test/ngRoute/routeSpec.js:822:7)\n```\n\nAlas, the fix from Pasvaz in #5746 lead to an error too:\n\n```\n        Expected '/bar/id1//23' to equal '/bar/id1/23'.\n        Error: Expected '/bar/id1//23' to equal '/bar/id1/23'.\n            at null.<anonymous> (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/test/ngRoute/routeSpec.js:832:34)\n            at Object.invoke (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/src/auto/injector.js:801:17)\n            at workFn (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/src/ngMock/angular-mocks.js:2187:20)\n            at window.inject.angular.mock.inject (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/src/ngMock/angular-mocks.js:2159:42)\n            at null.<anonymous> (/home/vtc/src/angular.js/test/ngRoute/routeSpec.js:822:7)l\n```\n\nNote the doubled slash, which is kind of awkward. So, a slash should be removed when the optional parameter is missing.\n\nNow string interpolation is done similar to the generation of the regexp in route, using a replace function.\n\nAll good, tests pass.\n\n**Other Comments:**\n\nI don't know what your preference is, should I reorder the commits in order to keep the tests passing for every single commit?",
