We are still waiting for more discussion within the team or more info from the contributor before making the final decision.",

    "body": "Fixes absolute links on legacy browsers when html5Mode is enabled.\r\n\r\nClicking on a link out of the base's href shouldn't trigger rewriting the URL. This behavior was changed since https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/24f7999bc16e347208aa18c418da85489286674b .\r\n\r\nThis resolves the issue I found on https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/24f7999bc16e347208aa18c418da85489286674b#commitcomment-7815179 which has created different behavior when it comes to absolute links on legacy browsers.\r\n\r\nMost of this is whitespace changes.\r\nI've added these cases to consider:\r\n1. Properly rewrite links starting with `/base/` when the base tag is present with a value of `/base/`.\r\n2. Don't rewrite links that have a href beginning with `/` not in within the base (i.e. `/outer_base/link`)\r\n3. Don't rewrite links at all if no base tag is present and href begins with `/`\r\n4. Rewrite absolute links with hashbang followed by `/` properly (.i.e. `#!/base/thing`).\r\n\r\nThis change is meant to resolve those cases that were not tested since 1.2.17 and have mismatching test cases. It's not to add any new features.",

But it is also a breaking change for anyone that did weird things such as `this.this.this.this` (and less weird: `$scope['this'] = ...`).",
