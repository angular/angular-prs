    "body": "we need to support multiple instances of angular on our page to support an enterprise rollout, where our instance is effectively 3rd party js. To do this we end up setting `$window.angular` to our instance of angular, but `window.angular` is undefined or their instance of angular if they have one. This will throw for us if they don't have their own instance of angular (`window.angular` is undefined.)  \r\n\r\nIn case you're wondering... we are also hijacking `$window` so that when we set `$window.angular` it doesn't set `window.angular`\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n.service('$window', function(){\r\n            // angular isn't actually wrapping window - so if you set something it is available on window\r\n            // this probably has side effects :(\r\n            var $window = Object.create(window);\r\n\r\n            // angular has some references to itself through window (search for $window.angular.callbacks)\r\n            // we want it to use ours not the \"real\" one if there is another one later...\r\n            $window.angular = angular;\r\n\r\n            // this is sacrificing JSONP with $http but that is ok with us\r\n            return $window;\r\n        })\r\n```",

This is a common\r\nstrategy for manipulating the $viewValue while the user is entering\r\ndata into an input field.\r\n\r\nWhen the $viewValue was changed inside the parser, the new viewValue\r\nwould be committed and used for validation. The original parser\r\nhowever would run last and pass the original (outdated) viewValue on\r\nto the validators, which could cause false positives, e.g. for\r\nminlength.\r\n\r\nThis is a regression since 1.3.0-rc.1, caused by https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/6046e14bd22491168116e61ffdf5fd3fed5f135c#diff-c244afd8def7f268b16ee91a0341c4b2L2055",

    "body": "This PR addresses a widespread accessibility issue: when `ng-click` is bound to non-interactive elements such as `<div>` or `<some-button>`, keyboard events are not fired by default even though ngAria dynamically adds `tabindex=\"0\"`. With this change, `keypress` events are dynamically bound alongside `ng-click` as long as ngAria's `bindKeypress` option is `true` and `ng-keypress` doesn't already exist. \r\n\r\nThis change overrides native DOM behavior in regards to `click` on custom controls like `<div tabIndex=\"0\">` (i.e. they don't fire from the keyboard). However, since ngAria adds `tabindex` by default it should further close the loop by eliminating the need to manually bind `ng-keypress`, since this is likely to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThis is intended to be a starting point–there may be a better way to accomplish this. It should also be brought up that this implementation only interfaces with `ng-keypress`, not `ng-keyup` or `ng-keydown`. \r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/9254 ",

    "body": "@lgalfaso here is a little PR for the numberFilter that doesn't aim at changing the current code structure. My goal here was to share tests that I've added while looking at this filter code. IMO it would be good to get them in before doing bigger refactorings on this filter.\r\n\r\nAs a side effect this PR fixes inconsistency in formatting numbers that round to zero.\r\n\r\nOnce again, I'm not trying to clean up the whole code here but do minimal changes that fixes inconsistencies and bring in more tests. For me the value of this PR is in tests. ",

We are still waiting for more discussion within the team or more info from the contributor before making the final decision.",
