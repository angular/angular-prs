Then when I had the time, I could sit down and knock off a dozen of these PRs at my leisure.   ",

Then when I had the time, I could sit down and knock off a dozen of these PRs at my leisure.   ",

Then when I had the time, I could sit down and knock off a dozen of these PRs at my leisure.   ",

Then when I had the time, I could sit down and knock off a dozen of these PRs at my leisure.   ",

Then when I had the time, I could sit down and knock off a dozen of these PRs at my leisure.   ",

Then when I had the time, I could sit down and knock off a dozen of these PRs at my leisure.   ",

Then when I had the time, I could sit down and knock off a dozen of these PRs at my leisure.   ",

Then when I had the time, I could sit down and knock off a dozen of these PRs at my leisure.   ",

    "body": "The $locationWatch function will loop forever if it is called when $browser decides that no transition needs to be made, firing extra $locationChangeStart events until it hits the 10 digest iterations loop. This happens commonly in the case when the browser delays too long in updating location.href and additional $locationWatches are fired before location.href is updated.\r\n\r\n(To see what I mean about location.href delays, try \"location.href = '/whatever'; alert(location.href);\" in the Chrome console)\r\n\r\nThis patch causes $locationWatch to return an unchanged count in the case when it has attempted to make the same transition twice in a row, thereby stopping the loop and allowing the browser to resolve.\r\n\r\nRepro: http://jsfiddle.net/dbinit/tMmKf",

Then when I had the time, I could sit down and knock off a dozen of these PRs at my leisure.   ",

Are things in $cacheFactory caches really trusted? In my mind, they should be. But there may be things I'm missing.\n\n2. How useful would this be for non-template resources? Would it be possible to make it more useful?\n\n3. Is there something I'm missing where perhaps this isn't actually necessary at all? It seemed to be an issue on [plnkr.co](http://plnkr.co/edit/XEtC9UILh7vJ7R4LKrnU?p=preview), although I haven't tested it outside of here just yet.\n\nIf it gets merged, it would be a simple thing to modify ng-include and other similar $sce-using core directives to work with it. Or perhaps it might make more sense to enable this as the default behaviour. I'm interested in finding out.",

Then when I had the time, I could sit down and knock off a dozen of these PRs at my leisure.   ",

Then when I had the time, I could sit down and knock off a dozen of these PRs at my leisure.   ",

    "body": "Reverting change introduced by chirayuk which needs further discussion.\r\nCheck line 29 (26 after commit): \"The goal is to prevent exploits against the expression language, but not to prevent exploits that were enabled by exposing sensitive JavaScript or browser apis on Scope.\"\r\n\r\nBut chirayuk's commit enforces a convention to regard all properties beginning or ending with underscore as private. Breaks every nonSQL db implementation i know, forcing overhead code.\r\n\r\nWhile white-/blacklisting accessible properties for expressions is a nice feat, this is imho the wrong approach and does not add much in terms of security.\r\nAn attacker at this level is able to read everything on scope. The advocated change and the respective tests convey a false sense of security to unaware devs and will lead to complacency.\r\n\r\nThis reverts commit 3d6a89e8888b14ae5cb5640464e12b7811853c7e.",
